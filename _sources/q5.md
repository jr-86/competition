# Question 5

## Problem

Ben and Lily play a game where they alternate picking pairs of numbers (A, B) where A and B are integers between 1 and 12. On his go Ben picks a pair, where as Lily gets to pick two pairs on each of her goes. However, the two pairs she picks must be in one of the following forms:
(A,B), (A,B+1)
(A,B), (A,B-1)
(A,B), (A+1,B)
(A,B), (A-1,B)

Any given pair (A,B) may only be picked once, and once one player has picked it the other player may not pick it.

They keep playing until one player cannot go.

If Lily plays well, how many pairs of numbers can she end up with, regardless of how Ben plays?
