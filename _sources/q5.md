# Question 5

## Problem

Ben and Lily play a game where they alternate picking pairs of numbers (A, B) where A and B are integers between 1 and 12. On his go Ben picks a pair, where as Lily gets to pick two pairs on each of her goes. However, the two pairs she picks must be in one of the following forms:
(A,B), (A,B+1)
(A,B), (A,B-1)
(A,B), (A+1,B)
(A,B), (A-1,B)

Any given pair (A,B) may only be picked once, and once one player has picked it the other player may not pick it.

They keep playing until one player cannot go.

If Lily plays well, how many pairs of numbers can she end up with, regardless of how Ben plays?

## Solution

### Reframing the problem

This problem is most easily understood by reframing it in two ways: 

Firstly, the final line of the problem needs us to consider the questions:
- What is the minimum number of pairs Lily can achieve, assuming Ben plays to minimise her score?
- What is the maximum number of pairs Lily can achieve, assuming Ben plays to maximise her score?

Secondly, the problem is more easily visualised when the pairs of numbers are placed into a square grid, with A denoting the row of the grid and B denoting the column.

It is easy to see that in each turn Lily must take pairs from two cells that are horizontally or vertically adjacent.

To expand on this, we will colour the cells black if the sum of A and B is odd, leaving them white otherwise.
