# Question 3

## Problem

Six UK cities are connected by a rail network such that there is a direct rail line connecting each pair of cities.

On Sundays, some lines may be closed for repair. Any city must be accessible by rail from any other (not necessarily directly) at all times.

Subject to this condition, in how many different ways can some of the lines be closed?

Please also demonstrate your solution.

## Solution

We can use graph theory here, and model the rail network as the complete graph $K_6$, with with 6 vertices representing stations, connected by edges representing railway lines.

The number of ways of closing the lines will be one less than the number of subgraphs of $K_6$ that connect all nodes (connected subgraphs), as one subgraph is $K_6$ itself, which doesn't involve closing any railway lines.

  <p>The complete graph with 6 vertices</p>
</div>

Each edge of this graph connects 2 vertices, so there are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ edges.

Thus the total number of subgraphs to consider is $2^{15} = 32768$.

These can be grouped by the number of edges they contain, the number of each given by $\binom{15}{e}$ for a graph of $e$ edges.

We want to complete the following table with numbers of connected and disconnected graphs for each number of edges, and total the connected subgraphs - each connected subgraph corresponds to a unique combination of closed railway lines.

| Number of Edges in Subgraph | Connected | Disconnected | Total  |
|-----------------------------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| 0                           |           |              | 1      |

Considering the simpler cases with subgraphs containing $e$ edges:

For $e < 5$ , all subgraphs are disconnected. You need 5 edges to connect 6 vertices.

For $e > 10$, all subgraphs are connected. This equates to removeing fewer than 5 edges, and 5 edges must be removed to disconnect a vertex.

For $e = 10$, 6 subgraphs will be disconnected. These are the 6 subgraphs where the 5 missing edges all connect to one vertex.

For $e = 5$, each connected subgraph must be equivalent to a spanning tree, there aren't enough edges to include cycles. The number of spanning trees on a complete graph of $n$ vertices is given by Cayley's Formula $n^{n-2}$. $6^4 = 1296$ subgraphs are connected.

We can update the table as follows:

| Number of Edges in Subgraph | Connected | Disconnected  | Total  |
|-----------------------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 0                           | 0         | 1             | 1      |

| 8                           |           |               | 6435   |
| 9                           |           |               | 5005   |

For subgraphs with %6<=e<=9$ edges, the mathematics becomes complex, so we will adopt a programmatic approach instead.

This approach could have been taken earlier, but the above table will help verify the validity of our results.

The following script will:
- Generate the vertices as integers 1-6
- Generate the edges as each possible pair of vertices
- Generate each subgraph as every possible combination of vertices
- Loop through each subgraph to:
  - Record its size (number of edges)
  - Determine how many vertices it connects with an algorithm
  - Classify it as connected or disconnected based on the number of vertices it connects
- Print the results

```python
import itertools

def expand_vertices(edge_combinations):
    """
    Expands a list of edge combinations to determine all the vertices that are connected
    by the given edges in a graph. Loops through the vertices. Terminates when no new vertices 
    can be added.

    Parameters:
    ----------
        edge_combinations (list):
            A list of lists, where each inner list has 2 integer elements and represents an edge

    Returns:
    --------
        vertices (list):
            A sorted list of vertices that are connected through the provided edges.
    """
    vertices = []

    # Store the vertices from the first edge
    vertices.extend(edge_combinations[0])

    # Track if any vertex was added in a given pass
    added_in_pass = True

    # Loop until no new vertex is added
    while added_in_pass:
        added_in_pass = False
        for edge in edge_combinations:
            # If either vertex of the edge is already in the vertices list, add the other vertex
            if edge[0] in vertices or edge[1] in vertices:
                if edge[0] not in vertices:
                    vertices.append(edge[0])
                    added_in_pass = True

                    vertices.append(edge[1])
                    added_in_pass = True
    return vertices


# Create the list of edges (combinations of 2 vertices from 1 to 6)
edges_list = list(itertools.combinations(range(1, 7), 2))

# Generate every possible distinct set of edges (subgraphs) formed from edges_list
subgraph_combinations = []
for r in range(1, len(edges_list) + 1):
    # Convert each combination from tuple to list
    subgraph_combinations.extend([list(comb)
                                  for comb in itertools.combinations(edges_list, r)])

# Create a table to store results for each subgraph size (1 to 15 edges)
table = []
total_true = 0
total_false = 0

# Loop through each subgraph combination, storing size and result
for i in range(1, 16):  # For every subgraph size (number of edges) from 1 to 15
    true_count = 0  # Count connected subgraphs
    false_count = 0 # Count disconnected subgraphs

    for subgraph in subgraph_combinations:
        if len(subgraph) == i:
            # For each subgraph, check which vertices are connected by its edges
            connected_vertices = expand_vertices(subgraph)
            # If all vertices from 1 to 6 are connected (i.e., the graph is fully connected)
            if len(connected_vertices) == 6:
                true_count += 1
            else:
                false_count += 1

    # Store subgraph size, true count (connected), and false count (disconnected)
    table.append((i, true_count, false_count))
    total_true += true_count
    total_false += false_count

# Print the results in a table
print("Number of Edges in Subgraph | Connected | Disconnected")
print("-------------------------------------------------------")
for r, true_count, false_count in table:  # Use r here, not i
    print(f"{r:<27} | {true_count:<9} | {false_count}")
print("-------------------------------------------------------")
print(f"Total                       | {total_true:<9} | {total_false}")
```

Note that the above script does not include the result of the single subgraph with no edges.

Using the output from the above script, we can complete the above table with the following:

| Number of Edges in Subgraph | Connected | Disconnected  | Total  |

| Total                       | 26704     | 6064          | 32768  |


Therefore, the answer is the total of the connected subgraphs minus the $e=15$ case where no lines are closed.

The answer is `26703`.
