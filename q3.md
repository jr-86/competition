# Question

```
Six UK cities are connected by a rail network such that there is a direct rail line connecting each pair of cities.

On Sundays, some lines may be closed for repair. Any city must be accessible by rail from any other (not necessarily directly) at all times.

Subject to this condition, in how many different ways can some of the lines be closed?

Please also demonstrate your solution.```
