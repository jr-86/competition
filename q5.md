# Question 5

## Problem

Ben and Lily play a game where they alternate picking pairs of numbers (A, B) where A and B are integers between 1 and 12. On his go Ben picks a pair, where as Lily gets to pick two pairs on each of her goes. However, the two pairs she picks must be in one of the following forms:

(A,B), (A,B+1)

(A,B), (A,B-1)

(A,B), (A+1,B)

(A,B), (A-1,B)

Any given pair (A,B) may only be picked once, and once one player has picked it the other player may not pick it.

They keep playing until one player cannot go.

If Lily plays well, how many pairs of numbers can she end up with, regardless of how Ben plays?

## Solution

### Reframing the problem

This problem is most easily understood by reframing it in two ways: 

Firstly, the final line of the problem needs us to consider the question:
- What is the maximum number of pairs Lily can achieve, assuming Ben plays to minimise her score?

Secondly, the problem is more easily visualised when the pairs of numbers are placed into a square grid, with A denoting the row of the grid and B denoting the column.

<div align="center">

    style="width: 70%;" />
</div>

It is easy to see that in each turn Lily must take pairs from two cells that are horizontally or vertically adjacent.

To expand on this, we will colour the cells black if the sum of A and B is odd, leaving them white otherwise.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c9ad653-6308-4311-b0de-8466b11978d6"
    style="width: 70%;" />
</div>

The remainder of this solution will refer to these (A,B) pairs grouped as such.
- A pair is 'white' if the sum of A and B is even
- A pair is 'black' if the sum of A and B is odd

There are 144 (A,B) pairs in total, with 72 black pairs and 72 white pairs.

It is clear that Lily must not only pick adjacent pairs - she must also pick one black and one white pair on any given turn.

### Lily's minimum score

#### Ben's strategy

To minimise the number of pairs Lily can take, Ben needs to ensure Lily cannot play a turn as quickly as possible.

In order to do this, he needs to exhaust the supply of either black or white pairs, because she must take an adjacent black pair and white pair every turn.

As such, Ben needs to take only black pairs or take only white pairs until there are no more of one colour. It does not matter which.

If Ben takes white pairs:
- After each player has taken 36 turns:
  - Ben has taken a white pair 36 times
  - Lily has taken a black pair and a white pair 36 times
- Ben takes a black pair on his 37th turn
- Lily cannot take her turn
- The game ends with Ben having 37 pairs and Lily having 72 (36 white, 36 black)

The above argument my be mirrored with identical logic if Ben takes black pairs instead.

It is not enough to show that Lily may be prevented from taking a turn after 36 turns - we need to ensure she can always take adjacent black and white pairs.

#### Lily's optimal response

In the event of Ben taking only one colour, we must check that there is a strategy Lily can follow to ensure that she can play all 36 turns, to avoid issues with adjacency.

A simple strategy for this is as follows

- If Ben is taking white pairs:
 - Lily should take a random white pair (A,B)
   - If A is odd, she should take the black pair (A, B+1) - the pair to the right on the grid
   - IF A is even, she should take the black pair (A, B-1) - the pair to the left on the grid
- If Ben is taking black pairs:
 - Lily should take a random black pair (A,B)
   - If A is odd, she should take the white pair (A, B-1) - the pair to the left on the grid
   - IF A is even, she should take the white pair (A, B+1) - the pair to the right on the grid  

The adjacent second pair will always be available as it is unique to the first random (available) pair, and Ben is not taking pairs of that colour.

Therefore Lily can take all 36 turns when facing Ben's optimal strategy.

### Solution

Based on the above, Lily can take `a minimum of 72 pairs`, regardless of Ben's play.

(It would be trivial to show that they could play co-operatively, giving her 96 pairs after 48 turns.)
